    <content type="text"><![CDATA[DefinationThe delegate is an object(Control Object) that executes a group of methods on behalf of another object. Control object is designed to pass user input to a data model. We want view classes to be used as is, and then we want control and model classes to have the freedom to customize those views. The delegate pattern allows for this. The key to the delegate pattern, is that the view establishes the questions that it needs answered and encodes them in a protocol. A protocol is a list of methods that a delegate must implement. Any object that fulfills the protocol can become a delegate. UITextFieldDelegate protocolLet’s take a closer look at the protocol we’ll implement next, the UITextFieldDelegate protocol. We’ve listed its methods below. For each of the seven methods, consult the documentation and provide an example implementation. Post one or two of your examples to the discussion forum. Editing lifecycle methods:textFieldShouldBeginEditing(_:)textFieldDidBeginEditing(_:)textFieldShouldEndEditing(_:)textFieldDidEndEditing(_:) textFieldShouldBeginEditing(_:) You could use this method to prevent the user from editing the text field’s contents more than once. textFieldDidBeginEditing(_:) You might use this method to show overlay views that are visible only while editing. textFieldShouldEndEditing(_:) The text field calls this method when it is asked to resign the first responder status. This can happen when the user selects another control or when you call the text field’s resignFirstResponder() method. Before the focus change occurs, however, the text field calls this method and gives you a chance to prevent the change from happening. Normally, you would return true from this method to allow the text field to resign the first responder status. You might return false, however, in cases where your delegate detects invalid contents in the text field. Returning false prevents the user from switching to another control until the text field contains a valid value. If you use this method to validate the contents of the text field, you might also want to use an overlay view to provide feedback to that effect. For example, you might display a small icon indicating the text is invalid. textFieldDidEndEditing(_:) This method is called after the text field resigns its first responder status. You can use this method to update your delegate’s state information. For example, you might use this method to hide overlay views that should be visible only while editing. The primary method for controlling text:textField(_:shouldChangeCharactersIn:replacementString:) textField The text field containing the text. range The range of characters to be replaced. string The replacement string for the specified range. During typing, this parameter normally contains only the single new character that was typed, but it may contain more characters if the user is pasting text. When the user deletes one or more characters, the replacement string is empty. The text field calls this method whenever user actions cause its text to change. Use this method to validate text as it is typed by the user. For example, you could use this method to prevent the user from entering anything but numerical values. The clear button (the ‘x’ on the right side of some text fields):textFieldShouldClear(_:) The text field calls this method in response to the user pressing the built-in clear button. (This button is not shown by default but can be enabled by changing the value in the clearButtonMode property of the text field.) This method is also called when editing begins and the clearsOnBeginEditing property of the text field is set to true. If you do not implement this method, the text field clears the text as if the method had returned true. The return key in the keyboard:textFieldShouldReturn(_:) The default implementation returns true, resigning first responder status. You can override this method in your custom responders to update your object’s state or perform other actions, such as removing the highlight from a selection. You can also return false, refusing to relinquish first responder status. If you override this method, you must call super (the superclass implementation) at some point in your code.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[OptionalsNil valueThe Nil value is the same as null in some other languages. 12345678910111213141516171819202122var z: Int?var s: Strings = "123"z = Int(s)var zee: Int?var string: Stringlet randomNumber = Int(arc4random() % 2)if randomNumber == 1 &#123; string = "123"&#125; else &#123; // always 0 string = "ABC"&#125;zee = Int(string)if let intValue = zee &#123; intValue * 2&#125; else &#123; "No value"&#125; Another Example With Nested StructuresSafely unwrapping optionals is a fundamental Swift skill and one can’t have too much practice. Let’s walk through another example using the following enum and structures. 1234567891011121314enum Genre: String &#123; case country, blues, folk&#125;struct Artist &#123; let name: String var primaryGenre: Genre?&#125;struct Song &#123; let title: String let released: Int let artist: Artist?&#125; The Song struct contains a property artist of optional type Artist?. Then, the Artist struct as a primaryGenre property of optional type Genre?. Genre is a simple enumeration with only three cases for simplicity. Now imagine we have the following instances of the Artist and Song structs. Here, johnny is assigned to the Artist property of walkTheLine. 12var johnny = Artist(name: "Johnny Cash", primaryGenre: Genre.country)var walkTheLine = Song(title: "I Walk the Line", released: 1956, artist: johnny) If we only had access to the the Song instance walkTheLine and we wanted to determine the primaryGenre of the song’s artist, we’d need some if lets. First, we’d need to get the artist. 12345if let artist = walkTheLine.artist &#123; print(artist.name)&#125; else &#123; print("Artist unknown")&#125; And within the first if let, we’d use another to get the primaryGenre. 12345678910if let artist = walkTheLine.artist &#123; if let genre = artist.primaryGenre &#123; // If there is no value for enum, it wll be "country" print("Primary genre: \(genre.rawValue)") &#125; else &#123; print("Primary genre unknown") &#125;&#125; else &#123; print("Artist unknown")&#125; If the genre property of artist is not nil, we know it has a value and can safely print out the genre. Example: Animals With and Without TailsHere’s another example: let’s say we have a struct called Animal. The Animal struct has a tail property and the tail property is an optional — not all animals have tails. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223struct Tail &#123; var length: String init(length: Int) &#123; self.length = "\(length)" &#125;&#125;struct Animal &#123; var name:String var species: String = "homo sapiens" var tail: Tail? init(name: String, species: String, tailLength:Int?) &#123; self.name = name self.species = species if let tailLength = tailLength &#123; self.tail = Tail(length: tailLength) &#125; else &#123; self.tail = nil &#125; &#125;&#125; 12345678var animal = Animal(name: "Lenny", species: "lemur", tailLength: 12)if let tailLength = animal.tail?.length&#123; print("\(animal.name)'s tail is \(tailLength) cm long")&#125; else &#123; print("\(animal.name) doesn't have a tail.")&#125;// "Lenny's tail is 12 cm long\n" 12345678var animal = Animal(name: "Gilbert", species: "Gorilla", tailLength: nil)if let tailLength = animal.tail?.length&#123; print("\(animal.name)'s tail is \(tailLength) cm long")&#125; else &#123; print("\(animal.name) doesn't have a tail.")&#125;// "Gilbert doesn't have a tail.\n" Nil Coalescing OperatorWe already used optional chaining to avoid nesting if lets, but what if all we want to do is provide tailLength with a default value if the optional chaining fails? Swift provides a useful operator, for situations like these, the nil coalescing operator, ??. 1&lt;optional expression&gt; ?? &lt;default case&gt; To use the operator, simply place ?? after the optional chaining expression, and then put a default value after the ??. 123let tailLength = animal.tail?.length ?? "0"print("tail length: \(tailLength)")// tail length: 0 Your TurnAssume the following structs and enum are defined. 1234567891011121314enum Genre: String &#123; case country, blues, folk&#125;struct Artist &#123; let name: String var primaryGenre: Genre?&#125;struct Song &#123; let title: String let released: Int var artist: Artist?&#125; Using the enums and structures, implement the getArtistGenre() function. Given a Song as input, return the raw value of the artist’s primary genre. If either the artist is nil or the primaryGenre is nil, then return an empty string. You must use optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator (??). 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829enum Genre: String &#123; case country, blues, folk&#125;struct Artist &#123; let name: String var primaryGenre: Genre?&#125;struct Song &#123; let title: String let released: Int var artist: Artist?&#125;func getArtistGenre(song: Song) -&gt; String &#123; if let songGenre = song.artist?.primaryGenre &#123; return songGenre.rawValue &#125; else &#123; let songGenre = song.artist?.primaryGenre?.rawValue ?? "" return songGenre &#125;&#125;var artisTest = Artist(name: "name", primaryGenre: nil)var test = Song(title: "title", released: 2021, artist: artisTest)print(getArtistGenre(song: test)) Example: Revisiting the Int() Initializer MethodLet’s say we’re using the Int() initializer method and invoking it on a variable that we are confident can be converted to an Int. 1let w = Int("123") We know this method is going to return the Int, 123, so in this case, unwrapping with the exclamation point is appropriate. We know there is little risk of a fatal error being thrown. We can place the exclamation point after w, like this: 1w! * 2 Or we could unwrap the return value directly, like this: 12let w = Int("123")!w * 2 In this second case the value assigned to w will be a plain old Int. Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals: Revisiting the Villain structWhat about declaring implicitly unwrapped optionals? When is an appropriate time to be so bold? Well, remember the evilScheme property of the Villain struct? We wanted the ability to create instances of Villain with the option of not providing an evilScheme at first. However, once we know that the evilScheme has been set, we can access the property as if it were a regular non-optional type. 123456789101112131415struct Villain &#123; let name: String // exclamation point means implicitly unwrapped var evilScheme: String! func performScheme() &#123; // no unwrapping necessary print("And now, I will \(evilScheme!)") &#125;&#125;var villain = Villain(name: "Billy", evilScheme: nil)villain.evilScheme = "steal from the cookie jar"// we know for sure the scheme has been setvillain.performScheme() There are a few things to note in the example above. The evilScheme property is now declared as an implicitly unwrapped optional. It’s type is written as String! instead of String?. In the performScheme() method, we reference evilScheme as any other property, without unwrapping. We call performScheme() once we know for a fact that evilScheme was set. The function assumes that evilScheme is not nil. If we treat an implicitly unwrapped optional that contains nil as if it contained a value, bad things can happen - including crashes! Difference between upwrapping an with ?, with ! and with implicit unwrapping?Unwrapping with ? is useful if you’re accessing nested properties or want some default behavior to occur if a value is nil. Using ! does not require providing a default value and is useful if you know that a value won’t be nil. However, if it is nil, the program will crash. Implicitly unwrapping optionals is also useful when you know a value won’t be nil, but you can use the same syntax as a normal property. However, unintended behavior and crashes can occur if it is nil. StringsA String is a StructYou just saw how a string can be initialized without a string literal. 1let stringWithPotential = String() Counting CharactersLet’s start with something straightforward. If you want to know how many characters are in a string, you use the count property. 12var str = "Meet me in St. Louis!""The string is \(str.count) characters long" Many real apps rely on counting characters - for example, a Twitter client that ensures a user is restricted to typing 140 or fewer characters. Accessing specific charactersWe can also conveniently access the characters at the beginning and end of a string. 12let firstLetter = str.firstlet isExcited = str.last == "!" Checking for SubstringsA substring is the term programmers use for any string that occurs within another string. We can check for the presence of a substring in different cases as shown below. 123str.contains("Lou")str.hasPrefix("Me")str.hasSuffix("in") contains() simply checks if the substring occurs anywhere in str. hasPrefix() and hasSuffix() are more specialized and check if the substring occurs at the beginning and end of the string respectively. Creating Variations of StringsWe can also use some string methods to generate different strings. 123str.lowercased()str.uppercased()String(str.reversed()) Converting strings to all-lowercase or all-uppercase is great when you want user input to be case-insensitive. And reversing a string is useful if you want to see if two strings are palindromes. Note in the last example, we need to use str.reversed() with a String initializer. If you look closely at the documentation for reversed(), you’ll see that it actually returns a ReversedCollection instead of a String. You won’t need to use this type directly, but just know that Swift uses it “under the hood” for efficiency. You can simply use the String() initializer to convert the result into a usable string. Appending Two StringsSimilar to concatenation, String also has an append() method that takes a string as an argument and attaches it to the string you’re mutating. 123var hello = "hello "let world = "world!"hello.append(world) Is the equivalent of 1hello = hello + world or 1hello += world With append() you don’t need to reassign hello a new value, and you’ll find the code is much more readable. Trimming charactersIn addition to append(), we can also remove characters from the end of a string. For example, you may want to remove all whitespace characters from the end of a user’s input. 12345var message = " Be back later! "while message.last == " " &#123; message.removeLast()&#125; And the same can be done at the beginning. 123while message.first == " " &#123; message.removeFirst()&#125; Replacing SubstringsWe can also modify the middle of strings. A common manipulation method is replacingOccurrences(of: String, with: String), which allows us to swap out one substring with another. 12let verbose = "We hope you are very excited to learn Swift. It's a very fun and very useful skill. Soon enough, you'll be writing your very own app!"let better = verbose.replacingOccurrences(of: "very ", with: "") This method might come in handy for implementing a Find and Replace feature, a profanity filter, and many other cases, and is great to have in your string manipulation bag of tricks. Note: To use the replaceOccurrences() method, you will need to add import Foundation to the top of your file. Foundation is a framework, which is just a name for a collection of commonly used code. Apple provides frameworks like Foundation so that developers, like you, don’t need to reinvent the wheel for common tasks like string manipulation. We’ve already imported Foundation in the playground, so you can just follow along with the examples. ArrayInitialize 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425//: ## Initializing Arrays//: The verbose wayvar numbers = Array&lt;Double&gt;()//: More often you will see ...var moreNumbers = [Double]()moreNumbers = [85.0, 90.0, 95.0]//: Array literal syntaxlet differentNumbers = [97.5, 98.5, 99.0]//: Array concatenation is super convenient in SwiftmoreNumbers += differentNumbers//: ## Swift Arrays have types//: An array can hold any type of objectstruct LightSwitch &#123; var on: Bool = true&#125;var circuit = [LightSwitch]()var livingRoomSwitch = LightSwitch()var kitchenSwitch = LightSwitch()var bathroomSwitch = LightSwitch()circuit = [livingRoomSwitch, kitchenSwitch, bathroomSwitch] Append Here is an array of type String, listing musicians we want to play in the car on our upcoming road trip. To add an item to the end of an array we can use the append method, like this: 12var musicians = ["Neil Young", "Kendrick Lamar", "Flo Rida", "Fetty Wap"]musicians.append("Rae Sremmurd") The array now looks like this: 1["Neil Young", "Kendrick Lamar", "Flo Rida", "Fetty Wap", "Rae Sremmurd"] Insert To add an item to a specific place in an array we can use the method, insert(at:). So, to add in “Dej Loaf” at index 2 we would write the following: 1musicians.insert("Dej Loaf", at: 2) The array now looks like this: 1["Neil Young", "Kendrick Lamar", "Dej Loaf", "Flo Rida", "Fetty Wap", "Rae Sremmurd"] Remove We can use a method called remove(at:) to remove an item at a particular index. If we remove the item at index 3, you can see that “Flo Rida” is removed: 1musicians.remove(at: 3) Subscripting Finally, if you want to retrieve an item at a particular index, you can use subscript syntax. Simply put the index in-between brackets after the array name, like so: 1let musician = musician[2] DictionaryInitialize12345// Initializer syntaxvar groupDict = [String:String]()// Dictionary literalvar animalGroupDict = ["whales":"pod", "geese":"flock", "lions": "pride"] 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637//: ## Dictionary operations//: insert, count, remove, update, retrievevar animalGroupsDict = ["whales":"pod", "geese":"flock", "lions": "pride"]//: Adding items to a dictionaryanimalGroupsDict["crows"] = "murder"animalGroupsDict["monkeys"] = "troop"//: The count method is available to all collections.animalGroupsDict.count // 5print(animalGroupsDict)//: Removing items from a dictionaryanimalGroupsDict["crows"] = nilanimalGroupsDict//: Updating a valueanimalGroupsDict["monkeys"] = "barrel"var group = animalGroupsDict.updateValue("gaggle", forKey: "geese")type(of: group)animalGroupsDict.updateValue("crash", forKey: "rhinoceroses")print(animalGroupsDict)//: ## Example//: Retrieving the value for a particular keylet groupOfWhales = animalGroupsDict["whales"]//: Why would the code below return an optional?//://: animalGroupsDict["whales"]//: We unwrap a value returned from a dictionary just like we would unwrap any other optional.if let groupOfWhales = animalGroupsDict["whales"] &#123; print("We saw a \(groupOfWhales) of whales from the boat.")&#125; else &#123; print("No value found for that key.")&#125;//: What happens if the key isn't found?if let groupOfSasquatches = animalGroupsDict["Sasquatches"] &#123; print("We saw a \(groupOfSasquatches) of Sasquatches on our hike.")&#125; else &#123; print("No value found for that key.")&#125; Here we use the removeValueForKey() method to remove the value for the string, “George Bush”. Since removeValueForKey() returns the value removed, we can reset the value of the new key, “George H. W. Bush” to be the previously returned value, “Miss Beazley.” 12var oldValue = presidentialPetsDict.removeValueForKey("George Bush")presidentialPetsDict["George W. Bush"] = oldValue We unwrap the retrieved value using if let and then use string interpolation to insert “Bo” into the string. The string is printed out as a part of the if block. 12345if let dog = presidentialDogs["Barack Obama"] &#123; print("Michele Obama walks \(dog) evey morning.")&#125; else &#123; print("No value found.")&#125; Sets123456789101112131415//: ## Sets//: Literal syntaxvar cutlery: Set = ["fork", "knife", "spoon"]var flowers:Set&lt;Character&gt; = ["🌷","🌹","🌸"]//: Initializer syntaxvar utensils = Set&lt;String&gt;()var trees = Set&lt;Character&gt;()//: ## Set operations//: Insert, Remove, Counttrees.insert("🌲")trees.insert("🌳")trees.insert("🌵")trees.remove("🌵")trees.count Class123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536class Movie &#123; let title: String let director: String let releaseYear: Int init(title: String, director: String, releaseYear: Int) &#123; self.title = title self.director = director self.releaseYear = releaseYear &#125;&#125;class MovieArchive &#123; var movies: [Movie] func filterByYear(year: Int) -&gt; [Movie] &#123; var filteredArray = [Movie]() for movie in self.movies &#123; if movie.releaseYear == year &#123; filteredArray.append(movie) &#125; &#125; return filteredArray &#125; init(movies: [Movie]) &#123; self.movies = movies &#125;&#125;let movie1 = Movie(title: "Bride of Frankenstein", director: "James Whale", releaseYear: 1935)let movie2 = Movie(title: "The Night Walker", director: "William Castle", releaseYear: 1964)let archive = MovieArchive(movies: [movie1, movie2])archive.filterByYear(year: 1935)archive.movies One important difference between structs and classes in Swift is how they’re handled in the computer or phone’s memory. Structs are passed by value while classes are passed by reference. Let’s see what this means with a simple example. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334class Musician &#123; var instrument: Instrument init(instrument: Instrument) &#123; self.instrument = instrument &#125;&#125;let duo = [Musician(instrument: .fiddle), Musician(instrument: .banjo)]//: Alternately, we could define a structstruct MusicianStruct &#123; var instrument: Instrument&#125;let structDuo = [MusicianStruct(instrument: .fiddle), MusicianStruct(instrument: .banjo)]func prepareForDuelingBanjos(musician: Musician) &#123; //var musicianCopy = musician //musicianCopy.instrument = .banjo musician.instrument = .banjo&#125;func prepareForDuelingBanjos(musician: MusicianStruct) &#123; var musicianCopy = musician musicianCopy.instrument = .banjo&#125;//: instances of classes are passed by referencelet fiddler = duo[0]prepareForDuelingBanjos(musician: fiddler)fiddler.instrument // banjo//: instances of structs are passed by valuelet fiddlerStruct = structDuo[0]prepareForDuelingBanjos(musician: fiddlerStruct)fiddlerStruct.instrument // fiddle Class InheritanceOne powerful feature of classes not available to structs is inheritance. Inheritance allows one class to take on the properties and methods of another class, as well as add its own functionality. To start, let’s say we have a Guitar class defined as the following. 12345678910111213class Guitar &#123; let strings: Int let frets: Int init(strings: Int, frets: Int) &#123; self.strings = strings self.frets = frets &#125; func pluckString() &#123; print("twang") &#125;&#125; This is a great start, but what if we then wanted to model an electric guitar. The electric guitar is a “kind of” guitar, but with a few differences. For example, the electric guitar has electronics for modifying the volume and tone of its output (check out the knobs on the lower body). We could define a new ElectricGuitar class by copy-pasting the GuitarClass and adding these different properties, but we can do much better. Instead, if we place a colon after the the class name and then specify the class we want to inherit from, the ElectricGuitar automatically has all the properties and methods of a guitar. 1234class ElectricGuitar: Guitar &#123; var volumeLevel: Float = 1.0 var toneLevel: Float = 1.0&#125; Now we have a new class, ElectricGuitar that has all the properties of Guitar with the additional properties for volume and tone. superclass A class that is inherited from subclass A class that inherits from another class (the superclass) parent class A class’s superclass child class A class that descended (inherited directly) from a parent class. descendant A class that inherited from an ancestor ancestor A class that has child or descendent classes root class A class with no superclass leaf class A class with no subclasses hierarchy A tree of inheritance relationships Overriding MethodsInheritance doesn’t just let you add to a class - you can also override its behavior. For example, since an electric guitar’s volume affects its sound, we can provide some custom functionality to the pluck() method. 12345678910override func pluckString() &#123; if volumeLevel &gt; 0.7 &#123; print("🎸🎸🎸 DRAOWWW") &#125; else if volumeLevel &gt; 0 &#123; print("🎸 twang") &#125; else &#123; // volumeLevel is 0 // Guitar's implementation of pluckString() super.pluckString() &#125;&#125; Overriding a method is as simple as redeclaring it and adding the override keyword before func. And if you ever need to fall back to the original functionality, as we do in the case when the volume is 0, the old implementation can be called super keyword. super just refers to the superclass (the Guitar class we’re inheriting from) so super.pluck() will call the pluck() method of theGuitar` class which will print “twang”. PolymorphismInheritance, or the ability of one class to take on the properties and methods of a superclass, leads us to the next topic - polymorphism. Polymorphism means “many forms.” It is a programming language feature by which a type can be substituted for another type. For example, since it inherits from a Guitar, an ElectricGuitar can be substituted anywhere that a Guitar would be used. In other words, an ElectricGuitar is a form of Guitar. Polymorphism allows for simpler code that avoids unnecessary specificity, and code that is flexible and expandable because it’s applicable to more than one type. If we were to add additional subclasses of Guitar, we could still use any of these types where a Guitar is used. override is used to indicate that a subclass’s method implementation will be substituted for a superclass’s method implementation. This is an aspect of polymorphism through inheritance. We saw an example of polymorphism previously when we used override to refer to a single Guitar type, and produced different behavior by substituting in an ElectricGuitar instead of a Guitar. We can see an example of polymorphism in action below. Because anyGuitar‘s type is Guitar we can assign any subclass of Guitar, including an ElectricGuitar to that variable. 12345var anyGuitar: Guitar = Guitar(strings: 6, frets: 20)anyGuitar.pluckString()anyGuitar = ElectricGuitar(strings: 6, frets: 20)anyGuitar.pluckString() Even though anyGuitar()‘s type is still Guitar, calling pluckString() will call the custom method we defined for ElectricGuitar. As a result, we can keep our code involving Guitar instances reusable, without sacrificing the functionality of any subclasses that happen to override a method. Type CastingFinally, if we know that anyGuitar is assigned an ElectricGuitar and we want to access the toneLevel property, we can convert the types with a special keyword: as. When using the as keyword the variable you want to convert goes on the left and the type you’re converting to goes on the right. 12345678result = variableToConvert as NewType// forcibly convert the types with &quot;as!&quot;let electricGuitar = anyGuitar as! ElectricGuitarelectricGuitar.toneLevel// or safely convert with &quot;if let&quot; with &quot;as?&quot;if let electricGuitar = anyGuitar as? ElectricGuitar &#123; electricGuitar.toneLevel&#125; You’ll also notice the use of as! and as? in this example. This may seem complicated but it’s really the same concept you learned about unwrapping optionals. Since there’s no guarantee that anyGuitar will actually be an ElectricGuitar, casting to an ElectricGuitar returns an optional of type Guitar?. To forcibly unwrap the result, we use as! and to conditionally unwrap with if let, we use as?. Defining TermsThere’s some terminology to cover, and then we’ll describe what happens when a method is called on a type that is defined as a class. Term Example Definition instance Guitar() A class or type that we have initialized. Can be referred to with a constant or variable, and refers to its own instance with self override override func pluckString() { } Used to indicate that this method implementation should supersede the superclass’s method implementation super super.someMethod() Used to retrieve and invoke a method implementation that has been overridden Protocols123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960// Initprotocol Souschef &#123; func chop(vegetable: String) -&gt; String func rinse(vegetable: String) -&gt; String&#125;class Roommate: Souschef, Equatable &#123; var hungry = true var name: String init(hungry: Bool, name: String) &#123; self.hungry = hungry self.name = name &#125; func chop(vegetable: String) -&gt; String &#123; return "She's choppin' \(vegetable)!" &#125; func rinse(vegetable: String) -&gt; String &#123; return "The \(vegetable) is so fresh and so clean" &#125;&#125;// implete the function outside the classfunc ==(lhs: Roommate, rhs: Roommate) -&gt; Bool &#123; return lhs.name == rhs.name &amp;&amp; lhs.hungry == rhs.hungry&#125;var roomie = Roommate(hungry: true, name: "Jennifer")var theBestRoomie = Roommate(hungry: true, name: "Jennifer")roomie == theBestRoomie//: ## A protocol is also a type, any class that adopts this protocolclass DinnerCrew &#123; var members: [Souschef] init(members: [Souschef]) &#123; self.members = members &#125;&#125;class RandomPasserby: Souschef &#123; var name: String init(name: String) &#123; self.name = name &#125; func chop(vegetable: String) -&gt; String &#123; return "She's choppin' \(vegetable)!" &#125; func rinse(vegetable: String) -&gt; String &#123; return "The \(vegetable) is so fresh and so clean" &#125;&#125;var newFriend = RandomPasserby(name: "Dave")var motleyDinnerCrew = DinnerCrew(members: [newFriend, roomie]) ExtensionsOne more powerful feature of Swift types is the ability to add new methods and properties through extensions. You’ll see extensions in action as you start building the Pitch Perfect app, so let’s take a look at an example before wrapping up with object oriented programming. To extend a class, simply use the extension keyword, followed by the type name. 1extension SomeClass &#123; ... &#125; Additionally, you can also add a colon after the type name followed by any number of protocols you’d like the type to conform to. Let’s rewrite the Roommate example so that it uses an extension to conform to Souschef. 123456789extension Roommate: Souschef &#123; func chop(vegetable: String) -&gt; String &#123; return "She's choppin' \(vegetable)!" &#125; func rinse(vegetable: String) -&gt; String &#123; return "The \(vegetable) is so fresh and so clean" &#125;&#125; Isn’t this the same as the previous example? It is, but with extensions, you don’t even need access to the original class definition for Roommate. As you begin your journey into iOS development, you’ll be working with many classes provided by Apple in which you do not have direct access to the code. However, with extensions you can add functionality to these types without ever modifying the original class definition. ReviewSomething that is passed by value such as an instance of a struct is copied when it’s assigned to a variable or passed to a function. Changing a property on the instance will only apply to the copy, and the original instance will remain unchanged. Values that are passed by reference, such as instances of classes, are not copied. Changing a value on a copy will also modify the original instance, since the copy is simply referencing the original.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[成绩说来惭愧，考了3年托福，一共四次，最终还是在临近申请前的不到一个月考出的分，而且分数也只是刚刚过百（见下图），尽管最终成绩很低，但我也有一些经验和心得与各位分享，当然，也会有一些我认为比较好的学习资源通过百度云的方式供大家学习。 学习顺序与学习时间对于理工科学生，强烈建议先学习GRE。理由有以下几点： GRE的数学对于理工科学生难度不高，不需要太多准备； GRE的verbal部分以背单词为主，这部分单词并不需要托福单词为基础，如果这部分单词搞定了，学托福难度会明显降低不少； GRE提分较快，只要刷题就会看到成效，不存在原地踏步的情况，适合初期准备。 但无论是托福和GRE我的建议都是利用暑假、寒假大块时间准备，切忌将学习英语的时间与上课/实习等杂糅在一起，这样不但英语能力不会很快见效，而且还会影响课内的学习成绩。总之用一个1-2个月的空闲时间全力学习英语之后考试一定是最高效的。 托福单词回归到托福学习。学习英语无论怎样最重要的还是背单词，单词积累的到位了，看文章听听力等自然得心应手，我比较明显的体会是在我单词掌握不扎实的时候看托福阅读都是不知所云的，仿佛在看一段加了密的文字，但在我学习GRE后，单词量得到了较大的提升，看托福阅读速度明显加快，读了一遍后内容也达到了其义自见的程度（再次说明先学GRE的好处），但不能忽视的是，很多GRE的单词书并不涵盖托福需要掌握的重点词汇，更不能轻视的是很多重要的四六级词汇，它们既不会出现在托福单词书中也不会出现在GRE单词书中，但它们的出现频率却惊人的高，这些单词一定要及时弥补！ 分享两个比较好的单词书（pdf），提取码见评论区： 托福救命800词&amp;四六级救命800词 7天搞定托福单词]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[第一遍：需5-10分钟快速浏览整篇论文，对其有个大概的了解。你也可以自己决定是否需要进一步阅读。该阶段分下面的几个步骤组成： 仔细阅读题目、摘要和引言； 阅读标题和小节标题，标题下的内容不必看。 阅读结论 看看参考文献，也许有你读过的论文。 在第一遍完成后，你应该可以回答以下五个问题： 类别：这篇论文是什么类型？测试类？对现有系统进行分析的？对原型系统进行描述的？ 内容：在你读过的论文中与其相关的有哪些？使用哪些理论基础来分析文章？ 正确性：结论是否有效？ 创新：该论文的主要创新是什么？ 清晰度：该论文是否条理清晰？ 回答出以上问题，你便清楚是否有必要继续阅读该论文，这也许与你的兴趣或研究领域有关，也可能是作者的结论不正确使之没必要再继续阅读。这也再次提醒你，在你写论文的时候，希望有人看你的论文，那么简明扼要的标题及摘要是非常重要的，无论是读者还是审稿人在用五分钟过一遍你的论文后，看不到文章的亮点也就对你的论文失去读下去的兴趣了。 第二遍：需1小时左右第二遍要仔细阅读论文，但忽略掉诸如证明之类的细节。 阅读过程中做好笔记记录重点，或在论文空白处标注出来。 仔细阅读论文中的数字、图表和其他插图。 尤其要注意图表： 轴标签是否正确？ 标示的结果是否有误差线？ 这些常见的错误能区分出该论文是粗制滥造的还是经过尽心做研究后的结果。 为了了解更多关于该论文的背景，记得要标记未读过的参考文献供进一步阅读。通过第二步的阅读，你应该能够掌握论文的主要内容。你也应该可以把论文的主旨及论据总结给别人。对于你感兴趣的论文，读到这个程度就可以了，但是对于那些在你研究领域内的论文来时，还远远不够。 有些情况你在读到第二步结束时仍然难以理解论文，可能的原因是主旨对你来说是全新的，还有不熟悉的术语和缩略词。也可能论文作者使用您不明白的论据或实验技术，导致大部分论文内容无法理解。除此之外，有些论文可能写得很差，也导致你无法理解该篇论文。亦或者可能是深夜，你很累了。如果是这样，你可以选择：（1）把论文放到一边，期望着在你走向事业成功的路上不需要理解它，（b）在了解了相关背景知识后，过段时间再回头读，或者（c）坚持不懈继续阅读。 第三遍：数小时要充分了解一篇论文，尤其你是审稿人时，需要进行第三步。第三步的关键是：在脑中勾勒出整篇论文，作出与作者相同的假设，重新创作。通过将这种重新创作与实际文章进行比较，您可以轻松地验证出论文的创新之处，也可以轻松找出一些不易察觉的缺陷和假设。 这一步需要读者精读论文，完成这一步读者便可验证论文中每一个假设是否成立，并且同时思考如果自己是本文作者的话会如何去体现自己的idea ，这种假设自己是作者的方法可以加深你对该论文论据及表述技巧上的理解，并且能从中学到这些技巧。在完成第三步的过程中，你应该时刻留意对于未来研究工作的新想法。 第三步是最耗费时间的，对于初学者来说可能要数小时，即便是有经验的学者也至少要一两个小时。当完成这一步后，你应该可以在脑海中重现构造论文的整个架构，同时能确定论文中哪些是好的，哪些是一般的论点。特别地，你也应该能明确指出论文中不清晰的假设、漏掉引用的相关工作以及论文中试验和分析的手段潜在的缺点。 以上内容参考知乎文章 延伸阅读： How to read a technical paper (JHU) How to read an academic paper Harvard EECS research guide]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[新冠病毒疫情原因，自从年前回家后，就没怎么出过门，出去两次也只是出门随便走走，没和陌生人说过话。目前疫情有较大好转，加之我头发太长，自从元旦那天在武汉剪了之后就没再动过，用理发店老板的话来讲，我这个“鸟巢”再不处理就可能要招来鸟了。 宅在家这么多天，除了偶尔的颈椎酸痛，大体上都很开心，主要是和父母沟通为主，为数不多的和别人交流也都是通过网络，感觉少了很多不必要的烦恼。自己每天做着自己认为该做的事，准备比赛也好，看看直播也罢，都让自己觉得自己还活着，没在虚度自己的光阴，和上学唯一的区别就是，我可以随意的掌控我自己的时间，至于效果怎么样，我也不得而知，但自由总是最宝贵的。 今天出门却感到有些伤感，不知道是因为在家呆的太久了对外面陌生的世界多了一份畏惧，还是在受疫情影响的社会背景下被气氛所感染，突然感觉到外面的世界并不是我曾经所认为的那么充满活力，相反，是一种死气沉沉的感觉。我对外面的一切都感到陌生，仿佛自己是一个关在监狱里5年的人，刚走出来，没有太多喜悦，反而是莫名的恐慌。 在家呆久了，每天依靠着网络，可以看到全世界各地的新闻，和天南海北的人聊天，不出门以为自己拥有了全世界。出了门才发现，原来我还是我，世界不知道还是不是之前的那个世界，但可以肯定的是我只不过是这个世界的一个过客罢了，开心就好。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[为了出国，提升背景为目的，我在大三报名了美赛，机缘巧合在一个留学交流群里，看到一个同学问有没有人有参加数模美赛的意向，要求是会写代码，我想着就去问问，毕竟我一个从小对数学无感，并且考了几次托福都上不了90的垃圾来说，除了写写代码还能干点什么呢？我就去说明了下自己的情况，他们考虑后也同意了，他们两个是同学，都是在经济学院，男生数学好，微积分什么的都接近满分，女生英语好，托福首考105，我了解到他们的情况之后压力还是很大的，毕竟我也只是一个懂$Matlab$语法的小白啊，数学建模这个词在我的印象里简直就像是“量子力学”一样的神秘（滑稽）。后来我们三个见面聊了聊，互相了解了下情况，我们都没有太多的数学建模基础，情况类似，之后也就没再多聊。 直到考试前，我们关于建模的事情聊得都不多，感觉我们三个都是比较内敛的人，我还算是其中比较外向的了，很多时候如果我不说话，估计群里就不会有人说话了。赶在寒假前期末考试后，我打算好好准备一下，虽然感觉毫无头绪，不知道从哪个高深的算法开始学起，但还是硬着头皮上，买了个课，每天听一听，后来就去北京学GRE了，数模什么的也就暂且搁置了，直到比赛前几周，才继续学一些知识。忘记说了，今年比较特殊的是，受疫情影响，美赛从一次改成了两次，一次是2月份，一次是3月份，我们当时想着或许3月能开学，就去搞3月的比赛（我实际上是觉得自己啥也不会，能拖几天是几天，拖，就恩拖） 然而躲得过初一却躲不过十五，3月份的比赛马上就到了，我们采用的是腾讯会议的方式线上交流。第一天早上起得很早，六点多就看赛题了，没记错的话，我3点多就醒了一次，估计是没准备太紧张了吧…拿到赛题，用词典把B题翻译了下，了解了题意，大概就是问想在海边建沙堡的话，怎么剪最好，我当时看了就觉得，这不就是开脑洞胡思乱想嘛，一个从小都没怎么去过海边的中国人，沙堡？别搞笑了，你问我怎么做汉堡好吃还差不多。 但当我用翻译软件把B题翻译了之后我才发现，或许B题是唯一一个我能理解的题目了，这就像是养龙，你说咋养就咋养，你说怎么搭沙堡就怎么搭，没有硬性规定，全靠你自己的理解，这种还算好的，毕竟只要说服了自己，就觉得没问题不是。在和两个队友商量后，也一致认为B题比较好理解，虽然暂时没有太明确的思路，但至少能靠脑子想想，编，就恩编。第一天，我们最开始思路很乱，没搞清楚应该从哪个点入手，毕竟对一个沙堡要分析的东西还是很多的，没有限定条件随便扯总不是一个事，搞数学的同学想从含水量的角度出发，我想从力的角度考虑，但奈何我的流体力学也只是学了一个皮毛，现在一个公式都想不起来的我，想从力学出发未免太难了点，搞数学的同学倒是想出了个思路，还写了不少式子，到了下午，搞数学的同学竟然已经写出了一个模型，虽然忽略了很多因素，但听起来觉得很有道理，达到了“自圆其说”的作用，于是我们就照着这个方向继续研究，提出问题，否决问题，提出方案，改正方案…就这样我慢慢觉得这个模型有搞头，至少我开始有了点思路。当晚搞数学的同学给我提出了一个难题，让我求一个函数的最小值，单求最小值不要紧，毕竟我还是上了点网课的，懂一点算法，但这函数也太复杂了，迭代套迭代，简直就是一个套娃，我完全没有思路。当晚我们还说明天要不要讨论一下F题，毕竟如果这个式子不能解决，可能这个思路就没法继续下去了。实在不行，我们就去做文字建模。。。 那晚我也没怎么睡好，因为我真的不知道这个“套娃”怎么解决，第二天早上起来我就自学了下可能能解决的办法–蒙特卡洛模拟，试着化简一下式子，再写写代码，听着两个队友在腾讯会议里讨论F题的题意，我得到了一个看起来“不错”的结果，我就在里面和他们说，如果我得到了第二问的结果，你们是觉得做F题还是B题？在我的语言诱导下，我们又开始脑洞大开建沙堡。可能是算出了个结果，有了信心，我们逐渐攻克各个难题，一起讨论，我认为我们仨合作还是很愉快的，总之就是在自圆其说的道路上越走越远233。 我们每天也不熬夜，大概10点左右就收工，早上八点集合，第三天，大部分问题也都已经想好。最后一天，该算的也算完了，我就给自己找点事做，下了个Latex（真的是作死），最后一天把我搞得死去活来，硬是坐在电脑前一天，从零入门Latex还好我有点Markdown基础，搞这个上手也比较快，我们改了又改，填了又填，最后在后半夜两点，在我们三个人一同的见证下交上了论文，4天的美赛到此结束，圆满收工。 这次美赛，收获很多，首先感谢我的两个队友，都很靠谱！我自己也算尽心尽力了，虽然基础差，但在这几天现学了不少东西，总之还是那句话，“尽吾志也而不能至者，可以无悔矣。”]]></content>

高一那年，我真的差点把自己废成了一块废铁。上课睡觉，聊天，看漫画，吃零食，跟着后面那些男生大呼小叫，把年轻的女老师气得眼圈含泪，然后自鸣得意而洋洋之。那真是一段不堪回首的日子，像色彩斑斓的黑洞，看上去奇观异彩，鬼魅般的吸引力却在不知不觉中一点点把你拉向无敌的深渊。于是下滑，堕落，而更加难过的是明明知道自己在堕落却无力去改变。习惯的力量的确大道了让我无可奈何，于是我放弃了最后的挣扎与努力。现在想想，那只是懦弱，那只是懒惰，那只是给自己自甘堕落所找的一个看似冠冕堂皇的理由，一切是自欺欺人。 可当时没有任何人来指着我的鼻尖骂我，说你是不是就想这样破罐子破摔，就像这样玩完你的一辈子，也许他们已经放弃了我，有时候我想，然后是极其嘲讽般的不屑，不屑以及自以为是的洒脱——谁稀罕谁。其实，那个时候真的是应该有一个人，就像很多人曾经经历过的那样，指着我的鼻尖，戳着我的脊梁说，你知不知道自己在做什么，请不清楚自己想要什么，请不清楚自己的明天会是什么。 可是，在无所谓的人也会有自己的底线的。正如再深的涧谷也会有它的低谷。一切就像滑楼梯，一路上放肆张扬地笑了下来，最后终于重重的摔在了下面，头破血流。 也许，人只有在痛的时候，才会认认真真反省自己走错了哪一步吧，总要摔些跟头，才能学会绕着道走。而这条再简单不过的路，我却付出了整整一年的青春时光才真正明白。一年，365天，可以让居里夫人发现镭，可以让爱因斯坦证出E=mc2，一年可以让一个婴儿学会跌跌撞撞走向母亲的怀抱，一年可以让一段轰轰烈烈的爱情开始和终了。可是这一年，我只得到了那一句话。所幸，并不亏，也并不晚 高二分科，我选了文科。你无法想象我所在的中学有着怎样烂的文科班——本科上线只有三人，本科上线三人是个什么概念？当我现在大学同学颇为自得的告诉我他们中学的班级北大清华一走几十个的时候，我轻轻的笑了笑。我所在的文科班，是一个本科上线三人的文科班，更具有讽刺意味的是，三个人全是复读生。我就是在大家或无奈或讽刺或无谓的目光里，毅然决绝地在文科报名表上写上了自己的名字，那真是我一生中写得最好看的一次。 我只是突然间觉醒了，觉得自己的一辈子不能就那样过。时候很多人问我怎么回事，也许他们是想在我这里听到一个传奇般的浪子回头的故事，而我当时所能想到的解释就只有这一句，我只是觉得，我的一辈子不应该就这样吊儿郎当的过去。 可我还是低估了过去那一年给我带来的影响。第一次月考，我考了年级第12名，也许这是一个听上去差强人意的成绩，可是，仅有的理智还是足以提醒我，那是一个本科上线三人的文科班，如果你不能把所有的人远远甩在后面，12名和120有什么区别？ 至今我还记得那次考了第一的那个女生，是一个不见经传的女孩子，瘦瘦小小，戴副厚厚的黑边眼镜，趴伏在书桌上的身影常常有些佝偻。而这个印象的得来，是因为所有的人永远只能看到她趴在桌上的身影。她一直是班里第一个来最后一个走的人。我一直对那种学生持有一种莫名的排斥和抵触情绪，总想你们有什么了不起，不就是死读书嘛，我要是像你们这样刻苦努力早是市里第一了。事实上直到那次考试成绩出来以后我仍然对她不屑 一顾。然后，我迎来了一生中最重要的一次班会。 我不知道要用怎样的分量去感谢那个班主任，因为如果不是她的那席话，现如今的我在哪里都不一定。班会上，她说：“这次考试非常能说明问题，该考好的人都考好了。”然后她扫了我一眼，我明白她的潜台词，也就是说在她看来我属于是没有理由考好的的那一堆人里的。奇怪，我居然没有脸红。不知道是太久的堕落已经在不知不觉中磨光了原本敏感的自尊，还是下意识里仍然对她的话不置可否，我当时面无表情的迎上了她的目光。她的眼睛只是平静地扫过我那里，然后继续：“我知道有些人自以为很聪明很有才气，看不起那些认真学习刻苦努力的同学，总觉得人家是笨鸟先飞是先天不足。可是我想说，你只是懦弱！你是不敢尝试，你只是不敢像他们一样去努力去刻苦，因为你怕自己即使刻苦了也比不上他们，刻苦了也考不了第一，反而遭人耻笑，你宁可不去尝试，只是因为有失败的风险，而你甚至连这一点风险都承担不起，因为，在你心底，你对自己根本就没有把握……”后面她又说了什么我已经想不起来了，我承认当时我是完完全全懵在那儿了，因为她说的那几句话。“你只是懦弱……”当时的感觉是雷轰一样把我整个人震住了，反反复复回荡在脑子里就只有那么一句话：“你只是懦弱。” 她是正确的。 那种突然觉醒的震撼是言语无法描述的，也是我不想用文字去表达的。你只能通过结果来想象，也只需要通过借结果来想象。那晚我在日记里写，试试吧。试一试自己那样刻苦那样努力的去学上一个月会不会见效。当时我根本不敢对自己承诺什么结果，也的却承诺不起。我只是抱着一个念头，试一试。 然后迎来了一生中最戏剧性的一个月。之所以说它戏剧性，只因为就像难以想象唐僧不再啰嗦孙悟空不再好斗猪八戒不再贪吃一样，我简直不敢相信那个早晨六点早自习上课到晚上十点晚自习下课一动也不动坐在位置上安安稳稳踏踏实实的人可以是我自己。其实并没有说起来那么简单的。我去一点一点地做的时候就已经发现了：要想在几天里改变365天来形成的习惯，太难；而要想在一个月里创造出令人瞠目结舌的奇迹来，也太难。习惯成自然啊。就像那句话说的，“心思平原放马，易放难收”，野惯了的心要想一下子收回来，谈何容易？常常做着做着就忍不住了，心开始浮躁，眼神也开始飘离，好几次差一点就要放弃。只是，在那个最危险的边缘晃荡的时候我总是压一压，告诉自己，忍不住的时候，再忍一下，其实说白了也就那么一句话：忍不住的时候，再忍一下。我承认自己是一个骨子里相当傲气的人，我就是不相信我刻苦起来会不如哪个人，我就是不信我真的去做一件事情的时候会做不到，我就是不信这世上真的有什么不可能的事。I believe that nothing is impossible. 然后，我迎来了那次期待已久的期中考试，至今我仍记得考完之后的感觉。抱着书走在回家的路上，茫茫的看着车水马龙人来人往，恍惚想真的考完了吗？为什么心里空空的没有着落？那的确是我一生中最特殊的一次考试，因为它关系着我此后的方向和道路选择，风险太大，我怎么安得下心？其实。考试结果想必大家已经猜到了。我的的确确让所有的人真正瞠目结舌了一次。是的，我考了第一，全市第一。 你永远无法想象那个结果于我而言有多么重要。知道成绩是我出乎寻常的平静。那时我才明白原来激扬和呐喊的冲动到了极点只是平静。当名字出现在了成绩单的第一行时，我默默地对自己说：记住了，这世上没有什么事情是不可能的。 从此我再也没有去改变过那种态度和方法。其实所有的方法说白了都是没有方法的，只有一个词：刻苦。 我坚守着那些不是方法的方法，也坚守着我的名字在成绩单上的位置，一直到高考前的最后一次考试，我始终是第一名。但是，真正的挑战还没有开始。即使我可以牢牢占据第一名的位置，即使我可以每次都把第二名甩下几十分，我知道，北大离我还是太远，远的连在梦里都看的不真切。所有的老师都坚信我将会是学校有史以来考得最好的一个文科生，而在他们的概念里，考得最好的文科生，意味着你可以上山大，运气好点儿的话也许可以伸伸手还能够上复旦甚至人大的门槛。而我只要北大。我从来没有对任何人讲起过我的志愿——如果可以称之为志愿的话。我只想把所有的力量都积蓄起来。 高三第二学期，我们搬进了刚刚落成的教学楼。搬迁的那天，楼道里吵得很，拖桌子拉板凳的声音在走廊里不绝于耳。我一个人不言不语的跳过窗子，踏上了二楼窗外那个大大的平台。对面是操场，初雪未融，空气湿冷，光秃秃的树枝直直的刺向天空。雪天的阳光凉凉的透过睫毛洒在眼睛里。眼睛静静的看着远远的天空。我默默在心里说：“等着吧，我要你见证一个奇迹。”我知道，这世上的确没有什么不可能的事情。 我从来不知道压力达到一定程度居然可以把人的潜能激发到那种地步的。我是一个极其不安分的人，可是那段时间我表现得无比耐心沉稳，踏实得像头老黄牛。事实上无数次我都面临崩溃的边缘了。高中5本历史书我翻来覆去背了整整六遍。当你把一本书也背上6遍的时候你就知道那是什么感觉了，只是，忍不住的时候，再忍一下。坚持的确是世上最伟大的一种品质。那段时间我唯一的休息方式就是站在走廊里看远处的天空。后来发现在对面的建筑墙壁上有一行大大的红字，是学校用来激励学生的吧。我不确定。可就是那句话陪我走过了高三最后的日子——意志的力量，是决定成败的力量。我用我所有的经历和体会去实践而且证明了这句话：意志的力量，是决定成败的力量。 呼啸而过的风卷着漫天的黄沙，在那个北方的春天里，我们一个个头发蓬乱，皮肤粗糙。死寂和喧嚣交替如同美国的执政党，规律的让人怀疑冥冥之中可有双奇异而魔力无穷的手。惶然而又茫然的我们在敬畏与期待中迎来又送走了一模，二模乃至N模。每根神经都被冷酷无情的事实锤炼的坚不可摧，无论是吟惯了杨柳岸晓风残月的诗情，还是习惯了信手涂鸦的画意。在这个来去匆匆的季节里，一切敏感纤细都奢侈的如同凯撒大帝的绸衣，徒留无数次的希望在无数次的失望前撞得粉身碎骨，无数次的激扬在无数次的颓丧下摔得头破血流。每个人都比昨天更加明白理想和现实之间那道不可逾越的鸿沟，同时也比昨天更加拼命努力挣扎，试图挤过那道窄窄的独木桥，哪怕明知是徒劳。 ——会是徒劳吗？ 当这个锥心的问号在夜阑人静的时候一次次猛烈叩击起了心门，每个人都难以承受那潮涌而至的恐慌和迷惘，于是逼着自己埋进去，埋进书本，埋进试卷，埋进密不透风的黑茧里——为的是有朝一日的破茧成蝶。青黑的眼圈，浮肿的眼袋，干燥的手指，焦虑的起了水泡的嘴角。那个春天我不知道流行的是粉蓝果绿还是黛紫银灰。小镜子被悄悄收起，因为不忍见到自己憔悴的面容和黯淡的眼睛，因为怕有什么会在汪洋恣意般在干旱已久的脸上纵横开来——上帝，我是个女孩子啊！ 上帝无言。无言微笑。微笑告诉我，你，心甘情愿。是的。我心甘情愿我不悔初衷我自己选择了这条路，平坦也好崎岖也罢我得走下去。我要走下去。我会走下去。 于是所有的呐喊被咽下去，所有的豪情被收起来。我像一头二月黄牛，默默踏步，无声前行。当拼搏被拼命所取代时，香格里拉已经幻化成心中恒远而朦胧的梦想，而所有的努力也只是为了让这梦想不再“美人如花隔去端”，哪怕青冥长天，纵然绿水波澜。 踏入考场的时候我很平静，“尽吾志也而不能至者，可以无悔矣”事实上我从来没有想过自己会考入北大以外的哪所学校。与其说这是一种自信，莫如说这是一种预感。我只是想，哪怕北大只招一个名额，为什么不可能是我？这世上没有什么事情是真正不可能发生的。 考完后走在回家的路上，看着依然匆匆的人群，心里依然空无着落。眼睛因为泪雾而模糊，视野里的东西却越发清晰。这在科学上有解释，我却宁愿相信是因为一切真实的感知都要以泪水和苦痛作为代价。是的，我们总是要学会放弃一些东西，在能得到另外一些东西。如果你所在乎的东西值得你为了它而付出一切，那么所有的放弃只是分娩前的阵痛。总要有所取舍的，蝴蝶的生命之所以如此短暂，是因为它的翅膀太过精致了。有时候，放弃是为了更好的得到，关键看你想要的究竟是什么，以及为了这想要的东西你愿意付出多大的代价。上帝对每一个人都是平等的。 事实上我怀念那段日子，而且永远感激它。不只是因为在那段时间里我完成了自己的过渡与蜕变，更是因为那时的一切深深烙在了我正处于可塑期的性格中，成为这一生永远的财富。那真的是多少钱都买不来的财富。人生中再也不会有哪个时期像那时一样专一地，单纯地，坚决地，几近顽固而又饱含信仰和希冀地，心无旁骛乃至与世隔绝地，为了一个认定的目标而奋斗。当你在若干年后某个悠闲的下午，回想起自己曾经的努力和放弃，曾经的坚忍和毅力，曾经的执着和付出，曾经的汗水和泪水，那会是怎样一种感动和庆幸，怎样一种欣慰和尊重+尊敬你自己。真的，在这个过程中，请允许我重复一遍，最重要的，是你自己。我感谢父母感谢老师感谢同学感谢朋友感谢所有关心我帮助我的人，但我最感谢的，是我自己。Nothing is impossible.这是我在一点一滴的努力与尝试中得到的东西。而且我也相信，这也将会是使我终身受益的东西。在这里，我把自己最信仰的一句话送给大家：Nothing is impossible. 分享此文给所有正在奋斗拼搏的你！]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[实验一现在布置自学同学第一周的任务： 用MATLAB产生0-100hz的方波信号，可以在数字框或者滚动条上改变方波频率。 用时域过零检测方法测量你产生的方波信号，测量误差越小越好，0.2hz以内打100分，0.5hz以内95分，1hz以内90分，5hz以内85分，10hz以内80分，以上评分标准是初步设的，不满意可以提 在你产生的方波信号上添加一直流分量，比如500-1000，如何保证你的程序也正常测量。 注意初始信号值如果全为0的情况下，如何保证你的程序也正常测量。 仿真做好了，把上学期编写的采集代码替换仿真数据即完成第一次实验，第一次实验最终通过测量信号发生器的信号频率来评分。学有余力的同学可以看看实验指导书的实验六编码器模式，另外一种通过硬件测量信号频率的方法，有一定难度。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[这是我看似很努力的一个学期，结果也还说得过去，但这些与我预想的都还差了太多，我用20分钟的时间做了一个反思，试图找出我存在的问题。 我的努力程度不够，我是一个自制力很差的人，向来如此，总是禁不住诱惑，无论是手机还是游戏，都是一沾上就会上瘾，所以这一学期我尽管花了不少时间在学习上，但相比于其他同学，可能还是不够吧，毕竟很多人可能是花费自己的全部时间去学习了。 我对某些并不感兴趣的学科没有学的认真，比如机械原理，热工基础。我并没有抱着一个为了得高分的心态，而是自认为学的够了就不学了，但很显然，这种学习程度对于达到90+以上的分数是不太可能的。 学习方法，自从上了大学，我好想对于学习方法就已经不再要求自己了，学得再也不聪明，总是以一种比较笨，低效的方式在学习，这也不是一个聪明人应该做的事情。 希望在最后的学期，我能逐渐克服这些问题，尽管GPA可能已经不会有太大的改观，但这学期对我来说尤为重要，我要考出GRE和TOEFL，我希望我能在这两项成绩的考试中证明自己，考出高分！也算不让自己的大学留下遗憾吧。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[外部中断概述 STM32的每个IO都可以作为外部中断输入。 STM32的中断控制器支持19个外部中断/事件请求： 线0~15：对应外部IO口的输入中断。 线16：连接到PVD输出。 线17：连接到RTC闹钟事件。 线18：连接到USB唤醒事件。 每个外部中断线可以独立的配置触发方式（上升沿，下降沿或者双边沿触发），触发/屏蔽，专用的状态位。 从上面可以看出，STM32供IO使用的中断线只有16个，但是STM32F10x系列的IO口多达上百个，那么中断线怎么跟io口对应呢？ GPIOx.0映射到EXTI0 GPIOx.1映射到EXTI1 … GPIOx.15映射到EXTI15 IO口外部中断在中断向量表中只分配了7个中断向量，也就是只能使用7个中断服务函数 从表中可以看出，外部中断线59分配一个中断向量，共用一个服务函数，外部中断线1015分配一个中断向量，共用一个中断服务函数。 外部中断常用库函数1234567891011121314//exti.c文件void GPIO_EXTILineConfig(uint8_t GPIO_PortSource, uint8_t GPIO_PinSource);//设置IO口与中断线的映射关系exp: GPIO_EXTILineConfig(GPIO_PortSourceGPIOE,GPIO_PinSource2);void EXTI_Init(EXTI_InitTypeDef* EXTI_InitStruct); //初始化中断线：触发方式等ITStatus EXTI_GetITStatus(uint32_t EXTI_Line);//判断中断线中断状态，是否发生void EXTI_ClearITPendingBit(uint32_t EXTI_Line);//清除中断线上的中断标志位 实际代码12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940#include "exti.h"#include "stm32f10x.h"#include "key.h"#include "delay.h"#include "led.h"void EXTIX_Init(void)&#123; EXTI_InitTypeDef EXTI_InitStruct; NVIC_InitTypeDef NVIC_InitStruct; KEY_Init(); RCC_APB2PeriphClockCmd(RCC_APB2Periph_AFIO,ENABLE); GPIO_EXTILineConfig(GPIO_PortSourceGPIOE,GPIO_PinSource4); EXTI_InitStruct.EXTI_Line = EXTI_Line4; EXTI_InitStruct.EXTI_LineCmd = ENABLE; EXTI_InitStruct.EXTI_Mode = EXTI_Mode_Interrupt; EXTI_InitStruct.EXTI_Trigger = EXTI_Trigger_Falling; EXTI_Init(&amp;EXTI_InitStruct); NVIC_InitStruct.NVIC_IRQChannel = EXTI4_IRQn; NVIC_InitStruct.NVIC_IRQChannelCmd = ENABLE; NVIC_InitStruct.NVIC_IRQChannelPreemptionPriority = 2; NVIC_InitStruct.NVIC_IRQChannelSubPriority = 2; NVIC_Init(&amp;NVIC_InitStruct);&#125;void EXTI4_IRQHandler(void)&#123; delay_ms(10); if(KEY0 == 0)&#123; LED0 = !LED0; LED1 = !LED1; &#125; //手动清除中断标志位 EXTI_ClearITPendingBit(EXTI_Line4);&#125; 1234567891011121314151617181920212223//main.c文件#include "stm32f10x.h"#include "led.h"#include "beep.h"#include "key.h"#include "sys.h"#include "delay.h"#include "exti.h"#include "usart.h"int main()&#123; delay_init(); //延时函数初始化 NVIC_PriorityGroupConfig(NVIC_PriorityGroup_2); LED_Init(); //LED端口初始化 KEY_Init(); //初始化与按键连接的硬件接口 EXTIX_Init(); LED0 = 0; //先点亮红灯 while(1) &#123; printf("OK\r\n"); &#125; &#125;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[NVIC中断介绍 CM3内核支持256个中断，其中包含了16个内核中断和240个外部中断，并且具有256级的可编程中断设置。 STM32并没有使用CM3内核的全部东西，而是只用了它的一部分。 STM32有84个中断，包括16个内核中断和68个可屏蔽中断，具有16级可编程的中断优先级。 STM32F103系列上面，又只有60个可屏蔽中断（在107系列才有68个） 中断管理方法首先，对STM32中断进行分组，组0~4。同时，对每个中断设置一个抢占优先级和一个响应优先级值。 分组配置是在寄存器SCB-&gt;AIRCR中配置： 抢占优先级 &amp; 响应优先级区别 高优先级的抢占优先级是可以打断正在进行的低抢占优先级中断的。 抢占优先级相同的中断，高响应优先级不可以打断低响应优先级的中断。 抢占优先级相同的中断，当两个中断同时发生的情况下，哪个响应优先级高，哪个先执行。 如果两个中断的抢占优先级和响应优先级都是一样的话，则看哪个中断先发生就先执行； 举例假定设置中断优先级组为2，然后设置中断3(RTC中断)的抢占优先级为2，响应优先级为1。 中断6（外部中断0）的抢占优先级为3，响应优先级为0。中断7（外部中断1）的抢占优先级为2，响应优先级为0。 那么这3个中断的优先级顺序为：中断7&gt;中断3&gt;中断6。 特别说明一般情况下，系统代码执行过程中，只设置一次中断优先级分组，比如分组2，设置好分组之后一般不会再改变分组。随意改变分组会导致中断管理混乱，程序出现意想不到的执行结果。 中断优先级分组函数1234567void NVIC_PriorityGroupConfig(uint32_t NVIC_PriorityGroup)&#123; assert_param(IS_NVIC_PRIORITY_GROUP(NVIC_PriorityGroup)); SCB-&gt;AIRCR = AIRCR_VECTKEY_MASK | NVIC_PriorityGroup;&#125;//比如：NVIC_PriorityGroupConfig(NVIC_PriorityGroup_2); 中断设置相关寄存器123456__IO uint8_t IP[240]; //中断优先级控制的寄存器组__IO uint32_t ISER[8]; //中断使能寄存器组__IO uint32_t ICER[8]; //中断失能寄存器组__IO uint32_t ISPR[8]; //中断挂起寄存器组__IO uint32_t ICPR[8]; //中断解挂寄存器组__IO uint32_t IABR[8]; //中断激活标志位寄存器组 MDK中NVIC寄存器结构体12345678910111213141516typedef struct&#123; __IO uint32_t ISER[8]; uint32_t RESERVED0[24]; __IO uint32_t ICER[8]; uint32_t RSERVED1[24]; __IO uint32_t ISPR[8]; uint32_t RESERVED2[24]; __IO uint32_t ICPR[8]; uint32_t RESERVED3[24]; __IO uint32_t IABR[8]; uint32_t RESERVED4[56]; __IO uint8_t IP[240]; uint32_t RESERVED5[644]; __O uint32_t STIR; &#125; NVIC_Type; 对于每个中断怎么设置优先级中断优先级控制的寄存器组：IP[240] 全称是：Interrupt Priority Registers 240个8位寄存器，每个中断使用一个寄存器来确定优先级。STM32F10x系列一共60个可屏蔽中断，使用IP[59]~IP[0]。 每个IP寄存器的高4位用来设置抢占和响应优先级（根据分组），低4位没有用到。 void NVIC_Init(NVIC_InitTypeDef* NVIC_InitStruct); 中断使能寄存器组：ISER[8] 作用：用来使能中断 32位寄存器，每个位控制一个中断的使能。STM32F10x只有60个可屏蔽中断，所以只使用了其中的ISER[0]和ISER[1]。 ISER[0]的bit0-bit31分别对应中断0-31。ISER[1]的bit0-27对应中断32~59； void NVIC_Init(NVIC_InitTypeDef* NVIC_InitStruct); 中断失能寄存器组：ICER[8] 作用：只读，通过它可以知道当前在执行的中断是哪一个 32位寄存器，每个位控制一个中断的失能。STM32F10x只有60个可屏蔽中断，所以只使用了其中的ICER[0]和ICER[1]。 ICER[0]的bit0~bit31分别对应中断0~31。ICER[1]的bit0~27对应中断32~59； 配置方法跟ISER一样static __INLINE uint32_t NVIC_GetActive(IRQn_Type IRQn) 中断挂起控制寄存器组：ISPR[8] 作用：用来挂起中断 中断解挂控制寄存器组：ICPR[8] 作用：用来解挂中断 123static __INLINE void NVIC_SetPendingIRQ(IRQn_Type IRQn)；static __INLINE uint32_t NVIC_GetPendingIRQ(IRQn_Type IRQn)；static __INLINE void NVIC_ClearPendingIRQ(IRQn_Type IRQn) 中断激活标志位寄存器组：IABR [8] 作用：只读，通过它可以知道当前在执行的中断是哪一个 如果对应位为1，说明该中断正在执行。 static __INLINE uint32_t NVIC_GetActive(IRQn_Type IRQn) 中断参数初始化函数12345678910111213141516void NVIC_Init(NVIC_InitTypeDef* NVIC_InitStruct);typedef struct&#123; uint8_t NVIC_IRQChannel; //设置中断通道 uint8_t NVIC_IRQChannelPreemptionPriority;//设置响应优先级 uint8_t NVIC_IRQChannelSubPriority; //设置抢占优先级 FunctionalState NVIC_IRQChannelCmd; //使能/使能&#125; NVIC_InitTypeDef;NVIC_InitTypeDef NVIC_InitStructure;NVIC_InitStructure.NVIC_IRQChannel = USART1_IRQn;//串口1中断NVIC_InitStructure.NVIC_IRQChannelPreemptionPriority=1 ;// 抢占优先级为1NVIC_InitStructure.NVIC_IRQChannelSubPriority = 2;// 子优先级位2NVIC_InitStructure.NVIC_IRQChannelCmd = ENABLE;//IRQ通道使能NVIC_Init(&amp;NVIC_InitStructure); //根据上面指定的参数初始化NVIC寄存器 中断优先级设置步骤 系统运行后先设置中断优先级分组。调用函数：void NVIC_PriorityGroupConfig(uint32_t NVIC_PriorityGroup);整个系统执行过程中，只设置一次中断分组。 针对每个中断，设置对应的抢占优先级和响应优先级：void NVIC_Init(NVIC_InitTypeDef* NVIC_InitStruct); 如果需要挂起/解挂，查看中断当前激活状态，分别调用相关函数即可。]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[首先注意在C和C++里不同 在C中定义一个结构体类型要用typedef: 1234typedef struct Student &#123; int a; &#125;Stu; 于是在声明变量的时候就可：Stu stu1 (如果没有typedef就必须用struct Student stu1;来声明) 这里的Stu实际上就是struct Student的别名。Stu==struct Student 另外这里也可以不写Student（于是也不能struct Student stu1;了，必须是Stu stu1;） 1234typedef struct &#123; int a; &#125;Stu; 但在c++里很简单，直接 1234struct Student &#123; int a; &#125;; 于是就定义了结构体类型Student，声明变量时直接Student stu2 其次 在c++中如果用typedef的话，又会造成区别： 1234struct Student&#123; int a;&#125;stu1; //stu1是一个变量 1234typedef struct Student2 &#123; int a; &#125;stu2; //stu2是一个结构体类型=struct Student 使用时可以直接访问stu1.a， 但是stu2则必须先stu2 s2;然后s2.a=10; 最后 typedef struct和struct的区别： 12345678typedef struct tagMyStruct &#123; int iNum; long lLength; &#125; MyStruct;//上面的tagMyStruct是标识符，//MyStruct是变量类型（相当于（int,char等）） 这语句实际上完成两个操作： 定义一个新的结构类型 12345struct tagMyStruct &#123; int iNum; long lLength; &#125;; typedef为这个新的结构起了一个名字，叫MyStruct 1 typedef struct tagMyStruct MyStruct; 12345typedef struct tagMyStruct &#123; int iNum; long lLength; &#125; MyStruct; 在C中，这个申明后申请结构变量的方法有两种： struct tagMyStruct 变量名 MyStruct 变量名 在c++中可以有 struct tagMyStruct 变量名 MyStruct 变量名 tagMyStruct 变量名]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[使用原因偶然之间看到一篇文章推荐使用VSCode，对于它我也是早有耳闻，一个开源的代码编辑器，但是之前觉得麻烦，觉得自己已经有了Visual Studio 2017就没必要再下一个代码编辑器了，当时以为VSCode不带有编译功能。 昨晚没事干，就下了个尝试一下啊，果然耳目一新，觉得从颜值也好，使用上也好都很舒服，但在配置的时候也遇到了问题，研究了好久才终于解决，特此记录！ 步骤 从官网安装VSCode 安装MinGW64,并将bin文件添加到Path路径中 安装插件 成功运行代码！ 具体过程从官网安装VSCode过程比较简单，从Google搜索VSCode进入官方网站，下载Windows的版本，运行即可。 安装MinGW64由于想在VSCode里跑C代码，最开始下了个C/C++的扩展程序，以为就可以用Fn+F5正常运行，实则不然，遇到报错！ 1提示这个内容：lauch:program does not exist 并要求我修改launch.json文件，可是我怎么修改也不管用…逐渐开始进入崩溃状态，想要直接写在这**的VSCode…可是作为一个颜控的我沉迷于VSCode的颜值无法自拔，决定再试试… 最终发现问题出现在没有安装MinGW64无法调试，于是搜索教程，前往官网下载，并将bin文件的目录添加到path路径中去。 并最终用gcc -v测试是否安装成功，要注意在cmd里测试，不要像我一样，在cmder里怎么测试都不成功… 安装具体教程点击这个链接 安装插件VSCode不安装插件是没有灵魂的… 我目前还不是很懂，也只是安装了一下几个插件 C/C++ C++ Intellisense Chinese Language Code Runner Seti-theme 运行代码最终用配置好的环境跑了一下hello，world成功编译！ 问题补充（修改于19.8.14）再次出现问题！之前成功编译只是通过了代码右上角的“播放”按键，也就是插件Code Runner，然而F5依然无法通过！ 继续查阅资料，查到一篇比较详细的教程，地址请点击 简单来讲就是还要修改.vscode文件夹里的launch.json和tasks.json文件。 而我是将launch.json修改为，其中gdb.exe的路径需要自己进行修改一下 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526&#123; "version": "0.2.0", "configurations": [ &#123; "name": "(gdb) Launch", // 配置名称，将会在启动配置的下拉菜单中显示 "type": "cppdbg", // 配置类型，这里只能为cppdbg "request": "launch", // 请求配置类型，可以为launch（启动）或attach（附加） "program": "$&#123;workspaceFolder&#125;/$&#123;fileBasenameNoExtension&#125;.exe",// 将要进行调试的程序的路径 "args": [], // 程序调试时传递给程序的命令行参数，一般设为空即可 "stopAtEntry": false, // 设为true时程序将暂停在程序入口处，一般设置为false "cwd": "$&#123;workspaceFolder&#125;", // 调试程序时的工作目录，一般为$&#123;workspaceFolder&#125;即代码所在目录 "environment": [], "externalConsole": true, // 调试时是否显示控制台窗口，一般设置为true显示控制台 "MIMode": "gdb", "miDebuggerPath": "D:\\MinGW64\\mingw64\\bin\\gdb.exe", // miDebugger的路径，注意这里要与MinGw的路径对应 "preLaunchTask": "g++", // 调试会话开始前执行的任务，一般为编译程序，c++为g++, c为gcc "setupCommands": [ &#123; "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb", "text": "-enable-pretty-printing", "ignoreFailures": true &#125; ] &#125; ] &#125; 将tasks.json修改为 1234567891011121314151617&#123; "version": "2.0.0", "command": "g++", "args": ["-g","$&#123;file&#125;","-o","$&#123;fileBasenameNoExtension&#125;.exe"], // 编译命令参数 "problemMatcher": &#123; "owner": "cpp", "fileLocation": ["relative", "$&#123;workspaceFolder&#125;"], "pattern": &#123; "regexp": "^(.*):(\\d+):(\\d+):\\s+(warning|error):\\s+(.*)$", "file": 1, "line": 2, "column": 3, "severity": 4, "message": 5 &#125; &#125;&#125; 最终实现F5调试并且可以实现断点debug等功能 使用VSCode编辑博客VSCode让我比较喜欢的一点是在于可以直接打开文件夹，并且继承了终端处理，git等，很多功能我还没有发掘出来，之后会深度体验一下VSCode！]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[用GCC编译Keil5的代码，了解GCC工具链引言本周接到任务，首先是熟悉STM32cubemx，既然是熟悉框也就不做太高的要求，毕竟也只是一个提升效率的工具，我就按照教程新建了一个简单地模板，算是知道怎么用cubemx从头开始建一个工程了。 而本周的第二个任务就是研究用GCC工具链编译Keil5的代码，这个的确对我来说难度不小，算是卡了我将近三天的时间，而出现这个问题的原因就是我基础不够牢靠，Keil5软件最基本的知识没有掌握，导致找不到问题的原因所在。还好我中途没有放弃，一直在尝试，也一直在找可能的原因，最终找到了，也算功夫不负有心人吧。 特此记录一下，因为我在出现这些问题之后并不能在网上找到答案，借此机会来帮助之后和我一样基础不好的小白吧。 问题产生在研究用GCC编译Keil5的代码的时候，我在网上找到了CSDN上的一个教程，讲解的还是十分详细的。 但我按照教程，把我用cubemx建的工程搞了一遍却出现了很多很多的bug，具体如下： 遇到这个问题之后我也查了一下，并没有找到原因，多数是说我没有定义，但我也不知道应该怎么定义呀！ 寻找问题我的直觉觉得问题可能出在教程中配置的部分，但同样的配置为什么会出现不同的结果呢？ 我于是按照正点原子的教程从头开始看了一下怎么配置一个用armcc编译的流水灯模板，因为之前我没自己搞过模板，于是发现了很多我之前不知道的细节，比如添加添加定义，头文件，修改output输出文件夹，而我出现的问题就是define没有添加，导致未定义。 12//在图中define一定要添加Define: USE_HAL_DRIVER,STM32F103xE,USE_HAL_DRIVER,STM32F103xE 解决之后成功编译！ 附上可编译模板的链接]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[暑假来深圳这边实习，做的是嵌入式方向，负责人分配给我的第一个任务是用Qt写一个串口调试助手。这个任务总体来讲难度适中，尽管我没接触过Qt，但能查到很多很多的资料，甚至包括别人写好的源代码，所以有很多的学习资源。 我第一天在同学的推荐下，看了一个入门的文档，《Qt 学习之路 2》，其中内容讲的比较基础，基本可以理解，算是能对Qt的语法了解个大概。而且如果实在不懂，也可以参看b站上的视频教程，是黑马程序员的教程，视频内容比较冗长，但对于初学者来说可能更好理解，各取所需，看个人选择。 因为负责人只给了我三天的时间，所以我也就花了一天左右的时间看教程，就开始看我在网上看的一份源码了。当时我的进度是黑马程序员看了不到10个视频，《Qt 学习之路 2》看了不到20节教程，虽然说看了不少，但我当时还是很慌的，对于我这种小白来说，还是不知道源代码是什么意思，但这个时候我能大概明白每个函数要做什么功能了，也就是我看懂了函数名，但函数里的句子我看不懂。 然后我就选择了按照这份代码自己复刻一份，算是尝试着自己写一下。 于是我新建了一个project，名字是Myserialport，发现源代码中main.cpp完全一样，也就是一个窗体的显示功能，很好理解，直接略去~ 上面的mainwindow.h文件里面有很多库函数的引用，函数的声明，我姑且认为不重要，暂时略去 而代码最多的就集中在mainwindow.cpp文件里了，也是我最需要解决的部分！ 这是我新建工程后的代码： 1234567891011121314#include "mainwindow.h"#include "ui_mainwindow.h"MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent) : QMainWindow(parent), ui(new Ui::MainWindow)&#123; ui-&gt;setupUi(this);&#125;MainWindow::~MainWindow()&#123; delete ui;&#125; 而源代码在MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent)中添加了很多窗体生成的初始化语句 123456789101112131415MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent) : QMainWindow(parent), ui(new Ui::MainWindow)&#123; ui-&gt;setupUi(this); textstate_receive = false; //初始化发送窗口状态为文本模式 textstate_send = false; //初始化接收窗口状态为文本模式 serialport = new QSerialPort; //创建QSerialPort类，需要在头文件中添加#include &lt;QSerialPort&gt; ui-&gt;send_button-&gt;setEnabled(false); //初始化接收按钮不可用 ui-&gt;close_port-&gt;setEnabled(false); //初始化接收按钮不可用 ui-&gt;Receive_text_window-&gt;setReadOnly(true);//讲接收窗口设置为只读窗口 setWindowTitle("串口调试助手"); //设置程序的标题 setWindowIcon(QIcon(":/images/exe.jpg")); //设置程序左上角图标 find_port(); //查找可用串口函数&#125; 以上语句还是比较好理解的，每句话我都进行了注释。 下面的代码就是定义各个函数，而.h文件里的很多函数声明也就很好理解了，也就是在.h文件里定义一下各个函数 比如以下很重要的两个函数，用于实现数据的发送和接收 123456789101112131415161718//发送数据void MainWindow::on_send_button_clicked()&#123; if(textstate_send == false) //文本模式 &#123; serialport-&gt;write(ui-&gt;Send_text_window-&gt;toPlainText().toUtf8()); &#125; if(textstate_send == true) //hex模式 &#123; QString str = ui-&gt;Send_text_window-&gt;toPlainText(); int num = str.toInt(); str = str.setNum(num,16); ui-&gt;Send_text_window-&gt;clear(); ui-&gt;Send_text_window-&gt;append(str); serialport-&gt;write(ui-&gt;Send_text_window-&gt;toPlainText().toLatin1()); &#125;&#125; 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627//窗口显示串口传来的数据void MainWindow::Read_Data()&#123; QByteArray buf; buf = serialport-&gt;readAll(); if(!buf.isEmpty()) //将数据显示到文本串口 &#123; if(textstate_receive == false) //文本模式 &#123; QString str = ui-&gt;Receive_text_window-&gt;toPlainText(); str += tr(buf); ui-&gt;Receive_text_window-&gt;clear(); ui-&gt;Receive_text_window-&gt;append(str); &#125; if(textstate_receive == true) //hex模式 &#123; QString str = ui-&gt;Receive_text_window-&gt;toPlainText(); // byteArray 转 16进制 QByteArray temp = buf.toHex().toUpper(); str += tr(temp); ui-&gt;Receive_text_window-&gt;clear(); ui-&gt;Receive_text_window-&gt;append(str); &#125; &#125; buf.clear(); //清空缓存区&#125; 最后实现了以下的界面，以及文本模式和16进制（hex模式）两种模式转换的数据收发 p.s.：尝试了很久想要解决中文无法显示的问题，最终无果… 有需要的话可以在这个链接下载嗷~]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[我为什么要学习C语言说来惭愧，作为一个工科学生，我竟然没有学过C语言，只在大一的时候学过一学期的VB，虽然语言这种东西说起来都差不多，但毕竟也是将近三年前的事了，早就忘光了。 可是不掌握C语言真的很麻烦，这尤其体现在做单片机上，单片机要求我们使用C语言，我当时连那些代码都看不懂，更别谈让我自己去写了。 正好，最近时间比较充沛。拿出时间来把C语言好好学学 p.s. 突然想起来我初中好像就学过C++了，但只是皮毛 我用什么工具学习C语言书籍：C程序设计语言（第二版 新版）→ 纸质 软件：VS2017, Xcode 其它：Google，CSDN，Baidu 我的第一段代码1234567#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;int main()&#123; printf("hello, world.\n"); system("pause"); //return 0;&#125; main函数：main是一个特殊的函数名——每个程序都从main函数的起点开始执行。main函数通常会调用其它函数来帮助完成某些工作 本例中main函数不需要任何参数 用双引号括起来的字符序列称为字符串或字符串常量 \n 表示换行符 第二段代码1234567891011121314151617181920#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;/* 当fatr = 0,20,...,300时，分别打印华氏温度与摄氏温度对照表 */main()&#123; int fahr, celsius; int lower, upper, step; lower = 0; /* 温度表的上限 */ upper = 300; /* 温度表的下限 */ step = 20; /* 步长 */ fahr = lower; while (fahr &lt;= upper) &#123; celsius = 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9; printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius); fahr = fahr + step; &#125; system("pause");&#125; 其中，int表示其后所列的变量为整数，与之对应的float表示浮点数（即可以带有小数部分） 为什么不用5/9？因为C语言存在舍位，小数部分都会被舍弃 Bit &amp; Byte 字节(Byte): 通常将可表示常用英文字符8位二进制称为一字节 比特(Bit)，亦称二进制位 ，1比特就是1位 1字节(Byte） = 8位(bit) 在ASCII码中，一个英文字母(不分大小写)占一个字节的空间，一个中文汉字占两个字节的空间 符号：英文标点占一个字节，中文标点占两个字节 1千吉字节（TB,Terabyte）=1024吉字节（2的40次方字节）（1TB=1024GB） 1吉字节（GB,Gigabyte）=1024兆字节（2的30次方字节）（1GB=1024MB） 1兆字节（MB,Megabyte）=1024千字节（2的20次方字节）（1MB=1024KB） 1千字节（KB,Kilobyte）=1024字节（2的10次方字节）（1KB=1024B） 1字节（Byte）= 8位（bit） 计算机中的位 二进制数系统中，每个0或1就是一个位(bit)，位是数据存储的最小单位。其中8bit就称为一个字节（Byte）。计算机中的CPU位数指的是CPU一次能处理的最大位数。例如32位计算机的CPU一次最多能处理32位数据。 所以char类型的存储大小为1个字节，也就是8位，这8位代表8位二进制， 浮点类型 类型 存储大小 精度 float 4 字节 6 位小数 double 8 字节 15 位小数 long double 16 字节 19 位小数 void类型 序号 类型与描述 1 函数返回为空C 中有各种函数都不返回值，或者您可以说它们返回空。不返回值的函数的返回类型为空。例如 void exit (int status); 2 函数参数为空C 中有各种函数不接受任何参数。不带参数的函数可以接受一个 void。例如 int rand(void); 3 指针指向 void类型为 void * 的指针代表对象的地址，而不是类型。例如，内存分配函数 void *malloc( size_t size ); 返回指向 void 的指针，可以转换为任何数据类型。 printf 输出```%a 浮点数、十六进制数字和p-记数法（c99%A 浮点数、十六进制数字和p-记法（c99）%c 一个字符(char)%C 一个ISO宽字符%d 有符号十进制整数(int)（%ld、%Ld：长整型数据(long),%hd：输出短整形。） %e 浮点数、e-记数法%E 浮点数、E-记数法%f 单精度浮点数(默认float)、十进制记数法（%.nf 这里n表示精确到小数位后n位.十进制计数）%g 根据数值不同自动选择%f或%e．%G 根据数值不同自动选择%f或%e.%i 有符号十进制数（与%d相同）%o 无符号八进制整数%p 指针%s 对应字符串char（%s = %hs = %hS 输出 窄字符）%S 对应宽字符串WCAHR（%ws = %S 输出宽字符串）%u 无符号十进制整数(unsigned int)%x 使用十六进制数字0xf的无符号十六进制整数 %X 使用十六进制数字0xf的无符号十六进制整数%% 打印一个百分号 %I64d 用于INT64 或者 long long%I64u 用于UINT64 或者 unsigned long long%I64x 用于64位16进制数据 ​]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[20190609该结束的课程终于都结束了，剩下的就是两个期末考试了。最近也是十分的空虚和无聊，呜呜。 昨天和黄智威出去吃饭，也是觉得自己突然刷新了自己对生活的认识，或许想在这个社会上生存，不能只想着简简单单的一个人打拼，在几个人的小团体里活着。想要在这个社会上获得你的地位，需要建立自己的人脉网，才能在走入社会后吃得开，显然，我目前并不是这样的人，我喜欢呆在自己极小的圈子，甚至在这个小圈子里我也很少和周围的人沟通交流，我也明白这样是不对的，慢慢去改变吧。 20190610今天早上起来之后就觉得不对头，脖子不是很舒服，像是落枕了。 这几天也没有好好休息，听了别人说每晚要早点睡觉，自己也在暗下决心，可是每晚躺倒床上就打起了精神，想要看会儿手机再睡，这一看就不是一会儿两会儿能解决的事情了，往往会熬夜到后半夜才会睡觉，周末利用空闲时间还想玩玩游戏，我应该知道自己颈椎不好不要总是低头玩手机用笔记本，但内心的躁动总是难以压抑，每次之后内心又充满了后悔。这就是太过放纵自己的结果。 身体最重要！永远不要和自己的身体开玩笑，永远不要做有害自己身体的事情，不然后悔都来不及 20190614感觉自己距离实习、工作还有好大的一段距离啊，真的要抓紧要努力了 自己没事做做眼保健操，保护眼睛 20190626今天没事闲的，在百度上搜索了一下自己，发现一个文档，是16年吉林一中所有毕业生的去向。说实话，这个表格我从没打开过，也没看过，所以我也不知道自己在这么一批人中到底处于一个什么层次什么位置。无奈，手贱点开了，内心难免升起波澜。我想如果我当年看了这个表格的话，我应该会选择复读吧。不是很好的学校的最差专业，这个报考也是很不明智。难怪我觉得来到这个学校和我期待的大学不一样，因为我的确没有去上我所期待的大学啊。 最开始来到这里之后先是觉得不适应，觉得自己不属于这里，后来慢慢适应了，也习惯这里的一切，后来自己又变成了这一批人里的中游，想想还是蛮扎心的。 今天看到这个也算给自己一个警示，我不该这么消沉，我应该去追求属于我自己的未来。包括来到大学，我也不是很努力，我一直都不是一个努力型人格，喜欢放纵自己，跟着自己的性子来，这样的话，等到大学毕业，我可能还是同样的结局，真是活该啊！ 人应该今早认识到一点：人这一生，靠的不光是实力，也看运气，运气也是实力的一种 20190702考完试啦，也把博客搬迁到我的mac上了，还是蛮简单的 遇到了点小问题但是都解决了，蛮好 Everything we can just google it! 20190703整理一下思路 为实习做准备需要学习：c, linux, arm 为下学期机器人学做准备需要学习：机器人学, Matlab 为出国做准备需要学习：toefl 为下学期课程做准备应该学习：机械原理等课程 为未来接触更新的知识做准备应该学习：python, tensorflow 为了更好的身体我应该：每天坚持健身 那么，到底是应该每天一个部分学一点还是应该阶段性的学习一个内容呢？ 20190706凡事应该谨言慎行，不可草率啊。事不过三，事不过三 我觉得我就是一个宅男，屌丝。。至少目前阶段是的，我承认。。要改吗？能改吗？，，我倒是很希望自己能成为一个技术控，人总是要有自己的一点特长的啊 昨晚看了个电影，蜘蛛侠英雄远征，个人觉得比较一般，以后最好不要看这种电影了 今天是最后一天休息了，明天开始生活就要走上正轨了，准确的说今天也不应该休息的。作为学生，每天必须要有八个小时的学习时间。这几天都没达到吧。。 20190707哥伦比亚大学门口的雕塑是女神雅典娜，还藏了一只猫头鹰，象征着智慧。 大学要培养的是可迁移的能力 没事多听听ted什么的别看直播了！ 科研项目并不是学校的那种科研，而是国外背景的科研 我第一喜欢的lpl输了，呜呜呜，以后不看比赛了，扎心呀 好好学习，报效祖国～～ 20190712原来变强是一定要付出代价的，健身也好，学英语也好，都是一个循序渐进的过程，不会有立竿见影的效果，但每天的练习一定会内化到身体里成为你的一种力量！无论什么时候都要顶住，顶住压力，坚持下去✊]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[电梯很长，人也不少，除了地铁口我就看到了一个穿着粉色t恤，年级估摸着有将近五十岁，个子不是很高的中年人，有一点油腻，猥琐的气质，但看起来不像是坏人 我故作镇定的走过去，和他说：”你为什么上来了？“ 他说：”我没做地铁来，我那里没有地铁，我骑车过来的。“ wdnmd…武汉哪里没地铁我是不信的 算了算了，你骑车就骑车吧，直接验货（滑稽） 我就找了个地方，从书包里掏出了我的手机 他说：”我没用过苹果手机，你这个手机咋用啊？” 我心想：哎呦，遇到外行了 他随便操作了几下，鬼知道他怎么操作的，竟然操作到了多任务栏，他尝试上滑关掉应用，竟然没关掉？？？ 我当时也懵了，这个情况我也没遇见过啊，我好几周都没用过这个手机了，我心里也不是很确定，不会是坏了吧？ 我就自己拿过来操作了几下，发现的确不行，我心里开始发慌，还好他也没有说什么 于是我就开始解释，手上还是在操作，想着是不是什么设置没打开？ 就在我调的时候他手机响了，我瞄了一眼，这TM不就是苹果手机吗？？？你跟我说你没用过苹果手机不会用？ wdnmd，你这有什么骗我的 内心暗自怀疑 我继续在那里试怎么关不掉多任务 也不知道我怎么按的，就长按了屏幕，左上角出现了一个红色的关闭按钮，我点了一下应用就关掉了 wdnmd！这什么智障设计，苹果真的不如我手里的安卓好用啊，这个设计也太脑残了吧。。。 暗自感叹了一下之后，心想：还好度过了难关，手机肯定没问题，你随便验 他又调了几下铃声什么的，发现都没问题 他又问我：“你带针没？我把卡插进去试一下。” 。。。 我带这玩意儿干啥，我哪知道您这么急啊 我说：“我没有，但肯定没问题，我用的好好的，你就放心吧。” 他的表情明显告诉我他不相信，他说他想试试话筒，他说他的手机话筒坏了 但他看是在是没法子，就说：“那就这样吧，有问题我给你打电话联系你。” 我说好 之后就开始转账了，我打开了我的支付宝收钱， 他很快扫了我的码，很果断的付了钱，谁知道我没收到提示 我心想原来你是用这种不付钱的骗术来骗我 哼，也太低级了吧，我早就听说过这种骗术了 别想用这种方法骗到我！ 我手里死死的握着我的手机不放，谁知道他开始急了 他说：“你咋没收到呢？我都付过去了啊？“ 我看着他手机上的账单，的确是这样，显示的已付款 难道这又是什么新型骗术吗？ 我手机疯狂刷新，还是没有，唉？咋回事 我看到我手机上的信号突然没了，半天之后才有，也就听到了那熟悉的：”支付宝到账…“ 突然心里一阵舒爽，这下落袋为安了哈哈 我就开学的走了，走之前回头看了他一眼，我看他急匆匆的往地铁站走，像是要去坐地铁 我心想，你TM不是做不了地铁吗？ 算了，管他呢，反正也结束了 看着他那粉色t恤的背影，我也回头往学校走，脑子里还在想着晚上吃点什么的问题 可谁又知道，事情才刚刚开始……]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[爸妈给换了个新手机，Huawei的，用着还挺顺手，用了好几年的iphone6sp就扔在寝室不用了。 旧手机在寝室放着一直看的挺烦的，也不是烦，就是想让每个东西都能有它们自己的归宿吧，不想让它们闲着。于是我就挂到了咸鱼上去，定了一个蛮高的价格，想着这么心爱的手机不想它这么就卖出去了… 果不其然，两天了没人来找我问，我心想，看来价格合适，不是那种贱卖的价格。我也没继续理它，反正我也不急着用这笔钱。 没想到今天下午我收到一个人的消息，他说他想买手机，还说他就在武汉，离我学校还挺近，说一会儿能不能当面交易，让我定一个地方。剧情发展的太快我根本没反应过来，而且他的果断和紧急让我更加的警觉，我在怀疑是不是什么骗局，毕竟闲鱼上的骗局还是很多的。 于是我马上追问：“在哪里交易？”（交易这个词怎么觉得怪怪的） 他说：“你定一个地方吧，我到时候直接给你现金。” 现金？？？ 我看到了一个关键词，立马勾起了我的警觉心。我马上在脑海里构想了各种可能的诈骗方式，比如什么钱是假钱，或者是他会以验机为名直接拿着我的手机跑路？…… 越想越后怕，我马上回：我不收现金，只接受转账。 我本以为他会因为我这么一说直接放弃这笔交易 没想到他直接回：没事，我们去银行门口见面，没问题的话我直接去ATM存钱，我手机里没钱！ 事情发展的更加扑朔迷离 奈何我一天下来也蛮累的，不如就用这个晚饭是时间休息下，把这个事情搞个明白，我倒是要看看这个人到底是个什么底细！ 紧接着我就挑了一个离学校在最近的地铁站，给他发了过去 我心想：地铁站人多而且有监控，就算你有问题，我也可以找别人来帮忙啊 我想着他会不会因为地点问题再次放弃交易 没想到，他又回了一句：我查查 真是出乎我的意料，难道他真的是要买手机？那为什么偏偏选择了我这个嘞？ 还没等我多考虑，他就回复我：”好的，我这就出门。“ 。。。 我当时人还在教室里呢，手机还在寝室躺着呢！ 心想：你是真急啊，你急的我害怕！… 我也来不及多想，收拾东西就往寝室走，因为我手机还没清理，里面还有好几10G的照片没删呢，还好我前几天把它们全上传到我的百度云里了。 回到寝室后，把手机刷掉，完全格式化，不想留下任何和我有关的信息 我在路上又想了一下，想到了更可怕的事情…他会不会用武力解决我并拿走我的手机… 虽然很离谱，但这种想法的确在我的脑子里的浮现过，而且当时脑子里的画面不是他一个人，是他带着他的一帮弟兄一起过来的，就像是那种黑帮电影里的感觉，一群光着膀子的大汉一排走过来…我是不是想象力太丰富了… 收拾的差不多，拿上了充电线就出门了，想着我耽误了这么久，他也该到了吧，临走前我还拿上了周二工程实训刚做好的喵喵锤。想着防身用hhh 然后我就往地铁站走了 到了地铁站，特意选了个出战的检票口，想着这旁边保安多得很，这下我的人身安全肯定没问题了吧 突然觉得自己真的机智，于是就找了个地方休息，也没再想什么有的没的。 过了十分钟他还是没消息，我心想，这该不会是不想买，但是要骗我时间的吧 话说我自己觉得我的时间宝贵，应该他不觉得吧 于是我就闲鱼给他发了个消息，说：你到了没？ 他过了半天才说：在路上，一刻钟到 一刻钟？？？我这么多年都没用过这个词，这个此时啥意思？是十五分钟的意思吗？ 我脑子里觉得是十五分钟，但还是不确定，我还特意去查了一下确认 哎，么得办法，买点东西是不容易啊，又冒着生命危险，又要浪费时间 可是我的书包也重的很啊，我还背着一个电脑，我总不能在这里傻站着等吧 关键是他说是十五分钟，到底是不是，谁知道啊？ 于是我就找了一个地方做了下去，刷起了手机。 刷手机时间还是过得快啊，大概不到二十分钟，他给我来了个电话 说他到了，没看到我。 我说：”我在地上坐着呢，你看到我没？“ 他说：”没有啊，你人呢？“ 我说：”我就在这个检票口出口啊。“ 他说：”我在上面，没在下面。“ 。。。 完了，之前的计划全部泡汤 但听他的声音，好像也不是很凶的样子，我就想着行吧，我上去会会你，反正我有小锤锤护身 然后我就上了电梯，往地铁口走]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[游戏里的SSR, SR, R, UR，N都是什么意思？ SSR：全称为superior super rare，表示特级超稀有; UR: 全称是Ultra Rare，表示极度稀有; SR: 全称是Super Rare，表示超稀有； R: 即Rare，表示稀有; N: 是Normal的缩写，表示普通; 64位是什么意思？一个 64 位的 CPU，内部可能有外部数据总线或不同大小的地址总线，可能比较大或比较小；术语“64位”也常用于描述这些总线的大小 在计算机架构中，64位整数、内存地址或其他数据单元，是指它们最高达到64位（8字节）宽。 API是什么？API（Application Programming Interface，应用程序编程接口） 对于浏览器来说（这也是所谓的客户端），Facebook的服务器就是一个应用程序编程接口。这意味着每当你在互联网上访问一个页面的时候，你都在与某个远程服务器的API发生交互。 API并不完全等同于远程服务器——它其实是服务器的一部分，负责接收请求并发送响应。 IDE是什么integreted development environment 即集成开发环境]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[为什么要做自己的博客？说到为什么要这么做，这个想法也是已经有很久了。当时的起因是我想通过互联网上的某个平台来记录自己的学习笔记或者自己的一些思考。在知乎等搜索了很多，都没有找到太合适的，其中包括公众号，简书，csdn等等。我觉得不合适的原因有的是因为网站太过烟火气，对我来说我觉得不够“干净”。有的是因为我觉得和我的圈子不符合，有的是因为我个人的喜好，最终都没有选择。有一天就突然萌生了做一个自己的博客的想法！ 但问题来了，怎么做呢？我完全摸不到头脑。我就去知乎查了一下看到了蛮多科普的帖子，但一翻，好长好长，其中也包括很多很多的代码。对于一个机械专业的学生来说，看到这些内心是恐惧的。于是…我就把那篇帖子收藏了，打算等我有时间再做…当时可能觉得的时间是大四…可是这个想法实际上一直深深的埋在我的心里。 上周，这学期该忙的事情几乎结束，剩下的就是为了期末考试做准备了，我向来是一个喜欢拖延的人，不到考试前一周应该是打不起学习的兴趣的。我就在教室看着电脑，可能又萌生了写点东西的想法，奈何没有平台给我发挥。于是突然决定，就现在！把博客给我搞出来 我花了多少时间？总共时长大概是3天白天的时间，对于我这个毫无基础的IT小白来说还是可以接受的（毕竟如果我不是搞这个的话估计也不会学习吧） 我是怎么做出来的？遇到了很多问题，也查了很多资料，通过别人的教程一步一步完善自己的博客 推荐链接：知乎上的一篇文章，我的启蒙 看了这个博客之后大部分操作就都可以完成了，当然你可能会像我一样，遇到很多的问题，那么怎么办呢？当然是自己查！而且很容易查到你想要的解决方法 这篇博客是我的努力目标，当时就是朝着这个方向努力完善 这篇博客讲了很多博客美化的内容，我都是自己一步一步搞的 另一个美化博客的教程，也很不错哦 以上部分完成了，你的博客基本就完成啦！如果你遇到了什么问题，都可以去google，相信你能得到你想要的答案~ 会不会出教程？应该不会，教程太多了，我还没那么牛，等我再学习学习吧… 如果换电脑了，想在新电脑上写博客，怎么迁移一个比较好的教程 想在两台电脑上同时写博客的方法利用git的分支功能！ 把生成的静态网页上传到master分支，把写的原文件上传到新建的hexo分支 每次在另一台电脑上写博客前，先git pull将本地文件更新，而在写好文章后要记得用 123git add . git commit -m &quot;&quot;git push 参考了知乎上的一篇答案，十分详细，对新手小白十分友好，点击跳转 做完这个对git的分支功能有了更深刻的认识~]]></content>
